in the "jvm arguments" do the following,

if you have 16gb of ram, change -Xmx2G to -Xmx10G

if you have 32gb of ram, change -Xmx2G to -Xmx16G

changing these numbers changes how much ram you allocate to minecraft, mods require more ram, you can change these numbers as much as you want but it is recommended to be at least 8gb 


if you dont know how to see how much ram you have (dear god help us all), open settings, go to system, then about, and then you should see this

"installed ram" is what you are looking for, then refer to the text above to see what to change Xmx to


then, you should be done and ready to play in the minecraft server, just click launch like you usually would
